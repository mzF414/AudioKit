**Demonstrate your bug in a test**

Make a fork of AudioKit and create a test in AudioKit's Tests folder and make a pull request showing the test failing to meet expectations.

**Or try the general community**

Creating a test is the only sure-fire way to get our attention, but if you feel like your problem 
is in implementing AudioKit in your own code, post your problem to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=AudioKit) with the #AudioKit hashtag.

**Or you really need professional help**

Sponsor my work on this project: https://github.com/sponsors/aure  

Certain tiers will allow you to reserve me for consulting time, and sponsors at any level get more attenion than non-sponsors.
